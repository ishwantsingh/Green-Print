        Direct carbon emissions Direct carbon emissions come from sources that
        are directly from the site that is producing a product.These emissions
        can also be referred to as scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. Scope 1
        emissions are emissions that are directly emitted from the site of the
        process or service. An example for industry would be the emissions
        related to burning a fuel on site. On the individual level, emissions
        from personal vehicles or gas burning stoves would fall under scope 1.
        Scope 2 emissions are the other emissions related to purchased
        electricity, heat, and/or steam used on site .In the US, the EPA has
        broken down electricity emission factors by state.

        Indirect carbon emissions Indirect carbon emissions are emissions from
        sources upstream or downstream from the process being studied, also
        known as scope 3 emissions. Examples of upstream, indirect carbon
        emissions may include: Transportation of materials/fuels Any energy used
        outside of the production facility Wastes produced outside of the
        production facility Examples of downstream, indirect carbon emissions
        may include: Any end-of-life process or treatments Product and waste
        transportation Emissions associated with selling the product
